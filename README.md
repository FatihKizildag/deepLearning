## Deep Learning based Perception for Autonomous Driving

This project contains a deep learning model developed for use in autonomous driving applications. The goal of the project is to perceive various scenes using computer vision techniques.

### Project Description

Autonomous driving requires vehicles to understand their surroundings and make accurate decisions. This project includes a deep learning model specifically trained to detect scenes in different contexts such as forests, glaciers, mountains, and seas.

### Technologies Used

The project is developed using the PyTorch library. The deep learning model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of labeled images capturing scenes in different contexts.

### Dataset

The dataset used for the project can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXbTtm-PlTQPO-zN443Ehr7EsYuIoer_/view?usp=share_link). The downloaded file contains scene images stored in separate folders based on their contexts.

### Installation

To run the project codes, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Google Drive account.
2. Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXbTtm-PlTQPO-zN443Ehr7EsYuIoer_/view?usp=share_link) and add it to your Google Drive.
3. Copy the project files to your computer.
4. Create a virtual environment in the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the project codes via Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
